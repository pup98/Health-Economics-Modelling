# Health-Economics-Modelling

In the field of clinical research, health economic modeling plays an essential role in guiding the decision-making of authorities, manufacturers, providers, experts, and payers. Modeling answers these decision-makersâ€™ questions regarding the practicality, commercial potential, clinical effectiveness, benefits, and affordability of a given intervention, as well as the overall impact it has on resources and to society.

In principle, the evaluative methods of this modeling should help patients receive affordable access to the best medical interventions. They also let manufacturers consistently produce and distribute interventions that meet the requirements of providers, payers, and regulators. In addition, successful economic modeling is vital for articulating the value of new interventions as a means of seeking market access. The ultimate result is a market-friendly equilibrium which meets the needs of all stakeholders.
